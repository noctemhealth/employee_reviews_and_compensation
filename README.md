# Employee Reviews & Compensation

## 1. Intent
As the general intent, we'd like to pay people fairly and appropriately for their work in helping to build NOCTEM. We also believe that reflection is an essential part of growth and want to create ongoing opportunities to consider the following:
* How does my work contribute to NOCTEM's success at this point in time?
* How could this change in the future?
* What do I want?
* What do I need to get there?

## 2. Reviews
At least once per year, your contributions will be evaluated in the context of your [level](#developer-levels) (i.e. Entry, Mid, Senior, Principal)

This evaluation will include a peer review (confidential but not anonymous); it is our belief that great contributions do not happen in a bubble - work happens in the context of our team and it is important to always mind where it comes from and where it goes.

To your review, please come prepared to advocate for your performance in either your current level or to make a case for "leveling-up". Also be prepared to share expectations and how they were met or not met.
 
After [discussion](#discussion-items) and sharing the aggregated themes from your [peer review](#peer-review-questions), we'll ask that you take a few days to reflect then share the points & themes that were most salient to you via email.

We'll then meet to finalize next steps - concluding with a written summary as well as a checklist to track development opportunities over time.
 
For now, Anne & I will schedule these and are very much open to doing them on request also.

## 3. Compensation
Given that we are a pre-Series A startup and that everyone's compensation is a combination of salary, equity, and benefits; raises will be awarded in recognition of performance over time but it is our intent that they be substantial, less-frequent, and aligned with the company's cash position. These raises will be in the form of either cash, equity, or some combination of each.
 
Anne & I would like compensation to be an ongoing dialog; please be prepared for this.
 
In the future, we will budget for raises explicitly and be transparent around their availability.

Best,
Mike
